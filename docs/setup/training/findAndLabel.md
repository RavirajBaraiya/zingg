# findAndLabel

This phase is composed of two phases namely [findTrainingData](findTrainingData.md) and [label](label.md). This will help experienced users to quicken the process of creating Training data.

`./zingg.sh --phase findAndLabel --conf config.json`

It's noted that this option is good for small datasets else if your findTrainingData takes a long time, the user will have to wait for the console for labeling. For details, refer to the individual phases: [findTrainingData](findTrainingData.md) and [label](label.md).
